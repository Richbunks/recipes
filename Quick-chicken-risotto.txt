SERVES 4

Ingredients
*12g dried porcini mushrooms
*2 chicken stock cubes
*1 tbsp coconut oil
*1 large leek, trimmed, washed and finely chopped
*5 sprigs of thyme
*400g skinless and boneless chicken thighs, cut into 2cm pieces
*300g mushrooms, brushed clean and roughly chopped into 2cm chunks
*225g arborio rice 
*small bunch of parsley, roughly chopped
*small bunch of chives, finely chopped
*juice of 1 lemon
*salt and black pepper


Method

1. Pour enough boiling water over the dried mushrooms to cover them generously, then leave to soak. Drop the stock cubes into a jug and, using boiling water, make up 750ml of stock.

2. Melt half of the oil in a large saucepan over a medium to high heat, then slide in the leek and thyme. Stir and cook for 2 minutes, then cover and leave to sweat for 2 minutes.

3. Take the lid off and crank up the heat to maximum. Add the chicken thigh pieces and a third of the chopped mushrooms. Cook, stirring every now and again, for 2 minutes. Slide in the rice and stir in to combine with the other ingredients.

4. Drain the sodden mushrooms and leave to one side, measuring out 150ml of the liquid. Pour the liquid into the pan with the sodden mushrooms and allow it to bubble up.

5. For the next 20 minutes, add a ladleful of the stock at a time to the rice, while constantly stirring. Don’t add too much stock to the pan otherwise you will lower the heat, which increases the cooking time. After 20 minutes you should have incorporated all of the stock into the pan, and you should be looking down at a creamy risotto – the rice should be just soft to the bite.

6. Put a lid on and leave the risotto to sit for a couple of minutes.

7. Meanwhile, melt the remaining oil in a large frying pan over a high heat, then add the remaining mushrooms. Fry without turning for 1 minute to caramelize.

8. Add the mushrooms to the risotto along with the chopped parsley, chives and lemon juice. Stir, taste for seasoning then serve
